# tyc-skeleton

This project is a skeleton framework for developing apps with my preferred toolkit, without having to start from scratch every time.

## Current Toolchain

* Gulp
* Webpack
* Backbone
* React
* Velocity.js
* ES6
* Less
* Mocha
* Chai
* Sinon (Note - can't use this until Sinon 2 comes out, current version doesn't expose UMD)

## Commands

* `Gulp` to build development version, running watch tasks and a dev server
* `Gulp test` to run unit tests, currenly only available in browser at test.html
* `Gulp prod` to create a production build in /dist
